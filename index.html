        <h2>The Sun</h2>
        <p>The Sun is the star at the heart of our solar system</p>
        <p> Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything - from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris - in its orbit.</p>
        <p>Even though the Sun is the center of our solar system and essential to our survival, it's only an average star in terms of its size. Stars up to 100 times larger have been found. And many solar systems have more than one star. By studying our Sun, scientists can better understand the workings of distant stars.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container planet" id="mercury">
        <h2>Mercury</h2>
        <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.</p>
        <p>Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.</p>
        <p>it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container planet" id="venus">
        <h2>Venus</h2>
        <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and our closest planetary neighbor.</p>
        <p> It's the hottest planet in our solar system, and is sometimes called Earth's twin.</p>
        <p>it takes sunlight about six minutes to travel from the Sun to Venus.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container planet" id="earth">
        <h2>Earth</h2>
        <p>Earth - our home planet - is the third planet from the Sun, and the fifth largest planet. It's the only place we know of inhabited by living things.</p>
        <p>it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface</p>
        <p>It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container planet" id="mars">
        <h2>Mars</h2>
        <p>Mars - the fourth planet from the Sun - is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere.</p>
        <p> This dynamic planet has seasons, polar ice caps, extinct volcanoes, canyons and weather.</p>
        <p>Even today, it is frequently called the "Red Planet" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container planet" id="jupiter">
        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
        <p>It's the largest planet in our solar system - if it were a hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could fit inside.</p>
        <p>But it has the shortest day in the solar system, taking only 10.5 hours to spin around once on its axis.</p>
        <p>it takes sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter.</p>
      </div> 
      <div class="container planet" id="saturn">
        <h2>Saturn</h2>
        <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun, and the second-largest planet in our solar system.</p>
        <p>Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also has dozens of moons.</p>
        <p>Saturn has the second-shortest day in the solar system. One day on Saturn takes only 10.7 hours </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container planet" id="uranus">
        <h2>Uranus</h2>
        <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and it has the third largest diameter of planets in our solar system.</p>
        <p>Uranus appears to spin sideways.</p>
        <p>it takes sunlight 2 hours and 40 minutes to travel from the Sun to Uranus.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container planet" id="neptune">
        <h2>Neptune</h2>    
        <p>Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system.</p>
        <p>Neptune is so far from the Sun that high noon on the big blue planet would seem like dim twilight to us.</p>
        <p>The warm light we see here on our home planet is roughly 900 times as bright as sunlight on Neptune.</p>
