        <h2>The Sun</h2>
        <p>The Sun is the star at the heart of our solar system</p>
        <p> Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything - from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris - in its orbit.</p>
        <p>Even though the Sun is the center of our solar system and essential to our survival, it's only an average star in terms of its size. Stars up to 100 times larger have been found. And many solar systems have more than one star. By studying our Sun, scientists can better understand the workings of distant stars.</p>

        <h2>Mercury</h2>
        <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.</p>
        <p>Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.</p>
